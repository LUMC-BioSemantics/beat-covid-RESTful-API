## The SPARQL queries for generating REST API with grlc 

The SPARQL queries created following the semantic model of [Beat-COVID19 project](https://github.com/LUMC-BioSemantics/beat-covid). A specific [FAIR Data Point](https://github.com/FAIRDataTeam/FAIRDataPoint-Spec) called [Beat covid FAIR Data Point](http://lumc-beat-covid.fair-dtls.surf-hosted.nl/) is used to increase the F (Findability regarding [FAIR data principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/)) of the Beat-COVID19 data and the queries are therefore of federated nature. The [grlc API](https://github.com/CLARIAH/grlc) is used to increase the I (Interoperability regarding FAIR data principles) the Beat-COVID19 data. The REST API generated by grlc allows querying the data through common REST messages.
